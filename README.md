## Hello World App
You also need to create an account on https://expo.io/ and install the "Expo Go" client app on your phone (or other testing devices) from the app store.

Follow the [get started guide](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/create-a-new-app/) to create a new app.

You should see a QR code on your computer screen. Scanning the QR code (with the Camera app on iPhones and with the Expo Go client app on Android phones) will launch your new app on your phone.

Change the text on your app to "Hello world from " followed by your name. To refresh you app after code change, you can shake your device and choose "Reload" from the menu.

Take a snapshot of your screen and submit it as a proof of your work.
